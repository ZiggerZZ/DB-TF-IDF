                         This place was a great choice. The food 
                         is amazing. And such generous portions.

                         You like the meal just wait until you 
                         try these after dinner mints.

                         You know, Doug, most guys are put off 
                         by my eye. It's nice to finally meet 
                         someone who's open-minded.  Ew!

                         I don't know. Something I couldnâ€™t quite 
                         put my finger on. Possibly his vile 
                         lizard tongue.

                         You're too picky.

               
                                     FRY
                         Yeah. If you rule out every guy with 
                         a lizard tongue or a low I.Q. or an 
                         explosive violent temper, of course 
                         you're gonna be lonely.

                         There's nothing wrong with having high 
                         standards. Now can we please stop --

                         The female Leela's problem is purely 
                         medical. Soon she will drop her eggs 
                         and they will hatch and all will be 
                         well.

                         You just have to give guys a chance. 
                         Sometimes you meet a guy and think he's 
                         a pig. But then later you realise he 
                         actually has a really good body.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Thank you all for the inspiring advice, 
                         but I'm perfectly happy with my life

                         Let's all take her out tonight. There's 
                         lots of great places to meet people.

                         Rings are stupid!

                         I just know these things. I've got what 
                         they call gaydar.
 
               
                                     LEELA

                         No?  OK, I got a lock on him.  Yep! 
                         He's gay!

                         That's right. Animals in desperate need 
                         of rescue. You see, Vergon 6 was once 
                         filled with a super dense substance 
                         known as dark matter, each pound of 
                         which weighs over ten thousand pounds.

                         Well, dark matter is extremely valuable 
                         as starship fuel. That's why it was 
                         all mined out, leaving the planet completely 
                         hollow.

                         Now it seems that the planet will collapse 
                         within three days. Incidentally, this 
                         will kill all the animals.

                         three or four captains sexier than you, 
                         and only one who was deadlier.

                         I heard that one time you single-handedly 
                         defeated a horde of rampaging somethings 
                         in the something something system.

                         The Killbots? A trifle! It was simply 
                         a matter of outsmarting them.

                         You see, Killbots have a preset kill 
                         limit. Knowing their weakness, I sent 
                         wave after wave of my own men at them, 
                         until they reached their limit and shutdown. 
                         Kif, show them the medal I won.

               [Ships Cockpit. Fry and Leela are standing in front of the couch 
               looking out of the windscreen into open space.]
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         What do you think of the view, Fry?
 
                         
               
                                     FRY
                         It really puts things in perspective. 
                         I mean, from up here an entire world 
                         can seem utterly insignificant.

               car. Leela presses a button and the windscreen wiper cleans it

               [Madison Cube Garden Pitch. The crew are sat watching what could 
               be a baseball game between the New New York Yankees and the Mars 
               Greenskins...]

                         Hey, nice seats! We're close enough 
                         to when you knock a player down with 
                         a beer bottle, he stays down.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         I don't get this. Is blernsball exactly 
                         the same as baseball?
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Baseball? God forbid!

                         Face it, Fry. Baseball was as boring 
                         as mom and apple pie. That's why they 
                         jazzed it up.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Boring? Baseball wasn't -- hmm, so they 
                         finally jazzed it up?
 
               
               [A player hits the ball. Fry jumps up, cheering.]

                         Home run! Ha ha! Yay! Right?

               
               [The ball is attached to a piece of elastic and springs back. 
               A player catches it and the momentum carries him so he flies 
               through the air with the ball. He reaches out and hits a base.]

                                     FRY
                         What just happened? Why is the ball 
                         on that springy thing?
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         It's traditional. Just like aluminium 
                         bats and the seventh inning grope.
 
                         
               
               [Another hit. A player jumps to catch the ball but misses it 
               and is caught by Bender.]

                         I got me a souvenir!  Aww, here you 
                         go, kid!
 
               
               [He hands the player to the boy.]

               
               [Madison Cube Garden Corridor. Zoidberg comes out of the Gents 
               and approaches a vendor.]

                         I'd like a jumbo squid log, please.
 
                         
               
                                     VENDOR

                                     ZOIDBERG
                         Alright, alright. Let me have one of 
                         your young on a roll.
 
               
                                     VENDOR
                         We're outta rolls.

               
                                     ZOIDBERG
                         Fine! Just give me something crawling 
                         with parasites.
 
               
               [Cut to: Madison Cube Garden Pitch. Back in the bleachers, Zoidberg

               a bite.]

                         this game. The blerns are loaded, the 
                         count's three blerns and two anti-blerns 
                         and the infield blern rule is in effect, 
                         right?
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Except for the word "blern" that was 
                         complete gibberish.
 
               
               [Something beeps. The blernsball falls into a hole and some things 
               come up in the pitch. The crowd cheers.]

                         hit 70 blerns!

                         He's good, alright. But he's no Clem 
                         Johnson. And Johnson played back in 
                         the days before steroid injections were 
                         mandatory.

                         have lasted one pitch in the old Robot 
                         Leagues! Now Wireless Joe Jackson, there 
                         was a blern hitting machine!

                         Exactly! He was a machine designed to 
                         hit blerns! I mean, come on, Wireless 
                         Joe was nothing but a programmable bat 
                         on wheels.

                         ball polishers, sprinkler systems. But

                         scraping up the filth. Is it a human

                         Great news, everyone. You'll be delivering 
                         a package to Chapek 9, a world where 
                         humans are killed on sight.

                         I'm glad you asked that question, Fry. 
                         You see, Chapek 9 was colonised centuries 
                         ago by a murderous crew of radical robot

                         Oh, so just 'cause a robot wants to 
                         kill humans that makes him a "radical"?

                         Hey, hold on. I understand these robots 
                         hate humans, but how do they feel about 
                         humanoid aliens?

                         That's why Bender will have to make 
                         the actual delivery.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Oh, I get it, make the robot do all 
                         the work!

                         ever had to do around here.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Well I'm not doing it! It's a robot 
                         holiday.
 
               
                                     FRY

                         Only Robanukah. The holiest two weeks 
                         on the robot calendar.

                         Oh, come on, Bender. Last month it was 
                         Robomadom and before that Robonza.

                         It wasn't just a blast. It was a sacred 
                         tribute to my ancestral prototypes which 
                         happened to take the form of a drinking 
                         contest.

                         Now, look here, Bender. I respect your 
                         diversity to the extent the law requires 
                         but you used up all your days off when 
                         you had that bout with Roberculosis.

                         Alright, I'll go. But so help me, I'll 
                         hold a grudge against every last stinking 
                         one of you for the rest of your lives.

                         So let me get this straight: This planet 
                         is completely uninhabited?
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         No. It's inhabited by robots!

               
                                     FRY
                         Oh. Kinda like how a warehouse is inhabited 
                         by boxes.

                         OK, Bender, we're here. It's time to 
                         get to work.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Yes, Miss Leela. Tote that space barge, 
                         lift that space pale.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Now we can't land on the surface because 
                         those robots will kill Fry and me. So 
                         we'll have to stay up here and lower 
                         you with the winch. And remember: You 
                         don't know humans, you don't work for 
                         humans, and, above all, you don't like 
                         humans.

                         Yeah, but I guess I'd be kinda angry 
                         too if I had to go to some uninhabited 
                         planet.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Maybe we ought to do something nice 
                         for him.

                         an easy decision. If only I had two 
                         or three minutes to think about it.

                         like robots and, if necessary, solve 
                         complex differential equations like

                         Silence! Come forward Bender. You will 
                         have the honour of executing the prisoners.
 
                         
               
                                     GREEN ELDER
                         Silence! I concur!

               
                                     YELLOW ELDER
                         Here: Use the ceremonial killer-ma-jig.
 
                         
               
                                     BENDER
                         Uh, I'm a little tired right now. Would 
                         it be alright if I just gave 'em a savage 
                         beating?
 
               
                                     BLUE ELDER
                         No! The Elders have spoken. Show us 
                         the killing skills than have made you 
                         a media darling.
 
               
                                     GREEN ELDER
                         Do it now! Kill them before they bring 
                         down our whole society!
 
               
                                     ELDERS
                         (chanting) Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! 
                         Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do 
                         it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Aww!  I can't kill them. Plenty of humans 
                         have mistreated robots but not these 
                         two. They're my friends. Humans are 
                         no threat to us. They're stupid, putrid 
                         cowards.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Damn right!

               
                                     BENDER
                         The fact is, humans are completely harmless.
 
                         
               
                                     BLUE ELDER
                         We're well aware of that.

               
                                     BENDER
                         You are?

               
                                     BLUE ELDER
                         Of course. But they're useful to us 
                         as a scapegoat to distract the public 
                         from their real problem.
 
               
                                     GREEN ELDER
                         Like our crippling lug nut shortage.
 
                         
               
                                     ORANGE ELDER
                         And a corrupt government of incompetent 
                         Robot Elders.
 
               
                                     YELLOW ELDER
                         Duh, that's for sure.

               
                                     BLUE ELDER
                         Quiet, Jimmy.

               
                                     BENDER
                         Well, I'm glad we got all that out in 
                         the open. We'll just let ourselves out.
 
                         
               
                                     GREEN ELDER
                         Silence! You all know too much.

               
                                     BLUE ELDER
                         Elders: Execute function, control, shift, 
                         kill!
 
               
               [They form a line and sharp things come out of their arms. They 
               move towards Fry, Leela and Bender who back away. Fry suddenly 
               leaps forward.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Stop! Take one more step and I'll breathe 
                         fire on you!
 
               
               [The Elders exchange glances.]

               
                                     LEELA
                         He'll do it. He's crazy!

               
                                     YELLOW ELDER
                         Can they really breathe fire or did 
                         we make that up?
 
               
                                     BLUE ELDER
                         Gee, I can't remember anymore! It might 
                         just be from that stupid movie.
 
               
                                     ORANGE ELDER
                         Was that the original or the re-make?
 
                         
               
               [The crew sneak away.]

               
                                     BLUE ELDER
                         I don't -- hey! They're getting away.
 
                         
               
               [Chapek 9 Surface. Outside the robot complex, Fry, Leela and 
               Bender run towards the winch with hundreds of robots chasing 
               them. They jump onto it and Leela presses the button.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         So long, suckers!  Uh, hello, suckers!
 
                         
               
                                     BENDER
                         Hey, hold on a second, I forgot to deliver 
                         the package.
 
               
               [He hands the parcel to a robot. It loses its balance and falls, 
               along with the rest of the robots. The parcel bursts open.]
 
               
               
                                     ROBOT #7

                         Hooray for the humans!

               
               [Ships Cockpit. The ship speeds out of orbit of Chapek 9. Bender 
               sees the decorations.]
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Wow, I can't believe you guys did all 
                         this for me! This is the best Robanukah 
                         ever!
 
               
                                     FRY
                         We wanted to show you that we really 
                         do respect your robot heritage.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Aww, thanks! You do know that I made 
                         Robanukah up to get out of work, right?
 
                         
               
                                     LEELA
                         Of course.

               
                                     FRY
                         But that doesn't make it any less meaningful.
 
                         
               
                                     BENDER
                         In that case, let the dancing begin! 
                          Hey, you guys are good. How the hell 
                         do you do that?
 
               
               [The crew enjoy the party and take several photos of the occasion.]
